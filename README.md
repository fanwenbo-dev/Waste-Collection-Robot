# Waste Collection Robot

## Project Overview

The Waste Collection Robot is designed to tackle the global challenge of waste management, aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UNSDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. The robot uses sensors to navigate and collect waste autonomously, with the potential to improve environmental sustainability.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: 
  - Ultrasonic sensors
  - Infrared sensors
  - Servo motors
  - Target sensor boards
  - RGB LED
  - Wi-Fi module (future integration)

- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE (C++)
  - Servo motor control
  - Sensor integration

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to design and create a robot capable of:
- Collecting and sorting waste autonomously.
- Navigating its environment using various sensors.
- Improving waste collection processes to reduce human effort and increase efficiency.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot uses ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance.
- **Waste Detection**: The robot uses infrared sensors to detect waste on the ground.
- **Future Improvements**: 
  - Integrating a waste-sorting mechanism based on waste type.
  - Adding Wi-Fi for wireless control.
  - Adding more sensors for better obstacle detection.

## Challenges and Improvements
- **Current Limitation**: The robot cannot yet pick up the waste effectively.
- **Future Enhancements**: 
  - Configuring a better indicator using RGB LEDs for different modes.
  - Optimizing the code for performance by reducing unnecessary loops.
  - Adding additional sensors for better obstacle avoidance.

## Team Members
- **Fan Wen Bo**: Project lead, coding for motors, sensors, and integration.
- **Ray Pang**: Design and fabrication of scoop and arms.
- **Ryan Chu**: Design and testing of base car model.
- **Irham**: Design and fabrication of the robot's body.
